* Cloud
---------
-> Cloud computing - Technological approach where computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way, so that lots of users get what they need;
-> Provide services by sharing resources;

-> Hardware Virtualization - a physical machine and a logical machine can be abstracted away from each other.
-> Virtualization - A single physical machine called a host could run many individual virtual instances called guests;

-> Hardware Virtualization platforms employ hypervisor;
-> Hypervisor - A piece of software that runs and manages virtual machines while also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that's indistinguishable from actual hardware;

-> Public Cloud - A large cluster of machines run by another company;
-> Private Cloud - Used by a single large cooperation and generally hosted on its own premises;
-> Hybrid Cloud -  Public & Private Cloud;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Services
-----------
-> X as a Service
-> IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service - use others network and servers; (abstracts away the infrastructure)
-> Paas - Platform as a Service - platform is provided for customers to run their services - execution engine;
-> Saas - Software as a Service - (abstracts away the server needed) - licensing the use of software to others while keeping the software centrally hosted and managed; - gmail for business / office 365 outlook;

* Cloud storage - duplicate data and ready available across geographic ; 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* IPv6 Addressing and Subnetting :
----------------------------------
- Address -> 128-bit | IPV4 - 32-bit;
- 8 groups of 16 bits -  each group - 4 hexadecimal numbers;
- Network id - 64-bits | Host id - 64 bits;
- begins with 2001:0db8 -> documentation and education;
- FF00:: - multicast (addressing hosts all at once);
- FE80:: - Link-local unicast addresses - allow for local network segment communications and are configured based on a host's MAC address; - receive n/w configurations; 
- loopback address - ::1 localhost

IPV6 compression
---------------
- remove any leading zeros from group;
- consecutive groups of zeros can be replaced with ::; 
- only once;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*IPv6 Header:
-------------
- Version - 4 bit;
- Class - (traffic class) - 8 bit;
- Flow label - 20 bit;
- Payload length - 16 bit;
- Next header - optional ;
- Hop limit - 8 bit - identical to TTL field in IPV4;
- Source address - 128
- Destination address - 128
- Data payload;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* IPv4 and IPv6 harmony
-----------------------
- IPV4 mapped address space - ipv6 address space that can be directly correlated to IPv4 address (80 zeros follwed by 16 ones) ; 
- IPV6 -> ipv4 -> IPv6 tunnels
-> IPV6 tunnes -> 
IPV6 server -------IPV6 traffic--------Encapuslate IPv4 datagram ----------------- IPV6 server;
- IPV6 tunnel brokers - companies that IPV6 tunneling provide endpoints;
